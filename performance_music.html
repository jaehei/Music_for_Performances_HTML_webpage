                    This web page has resources to create the best possible dance or gymnastics performance for a children's group.
                    These resources include lists of appropriate songs in different languages and genres as well as a collection of some useful external sources.
                    You can also sign-up for monthly updates to receive new music suggestions for your performances continually.

                <h2>Idea behind the website</h2>
                <p>
                    I have taught gymnastics now for eight years in total, and every year each group presents two different performances to an audience of parents.
                    This means that each year I need to find several songs with a good melody and without any mentions of swearwords or references to love.
                    As most songs are about break-ups or relationships, this can become quite a difficult task to complete.
                    So to help others with these same problems, I collected here some songs and other resources that could potentially help create good gymnastics or dance group performances.
